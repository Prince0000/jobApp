# Job Listing App

A React Native application for browsing and managing job listings. Users can bookmark jobs and view detailed information on each job. The app supports offline viewing of bookmarks and updates in real-time.

## Features

- Browse job listings with infinite scrolling.
- Bookmark jobs for later reference.
- View detailed information of each job in a full-screen modal.
- Dark mode design.
- Real-time updates with automatic polling.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- Expo CLI (>= 5.x)
- React Native development environment

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prince0000/jobApp.git
cd job-listing-app
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

### Install Expo CLI

If you donâ€™t have Expo CLI installed, install it globally using:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

or

```bash
yarn global add expo-cli

## Setup

### Configure Database (For Offline Bookmarking)

This app uses `localStorage` for storing bookmarks. No additional configuration is needed for the database.

### Running the App

To start the development server and run the app, use:

```bash

## Troubleshooting

- **`expo-sqlite` not found**: Ensure you have installed `expo-sqlite` using `expo install expo-sqlite`. For localStorage, make sure you are using `AsyncStorage` from `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.

- **Key errors in FlatList**: Ensure each item in your FlatList has a unique key by using `item.id.toString()` in the `keyExtractor`.
